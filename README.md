i3bgbar
=======

i3bar patched for background-color support!

installation
------------

Build by running `make` in the main directory, then `make install-i3bar` to install the binary.

Now edit your i3 config to use i3bgbar instead of the vanilla i3bar:

```
bar {
  i3bar_command i3bgbar
  # ....
}
```

why?
----

There will be powerline for i3 soon (hopefulleh)!
